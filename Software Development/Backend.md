# backend Developer 🚀

As a college student aspiring to become a back-end developer and land your first job, here are some essential things you should focus on learning:

### 1. **Programming Languages**

Learn at least one backend programming language, such as Python (Django, Flask), JavaScript (Node.js), Java (Spring), or Ruby (Ruby on Rails).

**Keep in mind that the choice of language depends on your interests and the job market in your region.**

**IMPORTANT**

- **first you need to learn the basics of the programming language you choose then only you'll understand the Python (Django, Flask), JavaScript (Node.js), Java (Spring), or Ruby (Ruby on Rails). I hope you understand!**
