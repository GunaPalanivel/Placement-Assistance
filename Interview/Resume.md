# Creating an ATS-Friendly Resume for College Students

## Tips for an ATS-Friendly Resume:

1. **Format and Structure**

   - **ATS-friendly design:** Simple format with clear headers, bullets, consistent fonts (10-12 pt, black on white).

   - **Clean structure:** Reverse-chronological order, logical sections like Contact, Summary (optional), Education, Skills, Experience, Awards (optional), Courses (optional), Languages (optional). Customize section names to match the job description.

   - **Avoid:** Graphics, complex fonts, tables, colors.

2. **Content and Tailoring:**

   - **Keywords:** Identify relevant keywords, skills, and qualifications from the job description. Integrate them naturally (30-40% keyword density).

   - **Action verbs:** Start bullet points with strong verbs (e.g., "managed," "spearheaded," "optimized").

   - **Tailor for each job:** Highlight relevant skills and experiences. Consider transferable skills from projects or volunteering.
